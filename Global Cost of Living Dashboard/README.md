# Global Cost of Living Dashboard Introduction:
The Global Cost of Living Dashboard is created by taking data from the Numbeo website for the year 2022.These indices are relative to New York City (USA). Which means that for New York City, each index should be 100(%). If another capital has, for example, Cost of index of 120, it means that on an average in that city rents are 20% more expensive than in New York City.

To simplify the comparison process, I limited my selection to capital cities only. This enabled me to present a clear and simple visualization.

## Focused Audience: 
My target audience for this visualization consists of professionals, students, and individuals who have an interest in relocating to another country in the future or who are interested in international statistics and can benefit from the information presented in this visualization. 

## Why do I select these charts? 

1. Global Cost of Living Index: (Choropleth Map Chart) To illustrate the cost of living index, I used choropleth maps. This method involves dividing geographic areas into colored sections based on the index category, which is grouped into five categories and patterned relative to others. By utilizing this approach, the values of the cost of living index can be easily visualized over a geographical area, allowing for the identification of variations by country across the continent. 

2. Average Monthly Salary: (Tree Map Chart) To compare the average monthly salaries of countries worldwide, I created a tree map chart. This chart enables viewers to easily identify the countries with the highest and lowest average incomes and compare them with others in the same continent. By correlating color and size dimensions with the tree structure, patterns can be easily identified, making it simpler to discern the most relevant information. Another advantage of treemaps is that they optimize the use of space, allowing for the display of many data points on the screen at once without compromising readability. 

3. Basic utility Expenses: (Bubble chart) To display the Basic utility expenses variable across countries, I opted for a Bubble chart. This type of chart is a combination of a Scatter Plot and a Proportional Area Chart, and is useful for visualizing multiple variables simultaneously. In a Bubble chart, categorized circles are positioned and sized in relation to each other, allowing viewers to easily compare and understand the relationships between data points. Additionally, color shading and size can be used to group and differentiate data values. Overall, this chart provides a clear and visually appealing representation of the data, allowing viewers to easily draw inferences and analyze patterns. 

4. Education fees in Private School: (Stacked Bar chart) In this worksheet, I have utilized a stacked bar chart to depict two categories within the Education expense variable - primary education and preschool education. This allows the audience to easily comprehend and relate to the data, unlike a traditional bar chart which displays only a single categorical variable. The stacking order is determined by data value and period, with the primary variable shown across the length of the bar and the secondary variable as stacked segments within each categorical bar. To maintain clarity, it is essential to follow the start-at-zero rule in bar or line charts, and in this chart, it has been adhered to, with the descending order and scale adjusted to enhance contrast between data values. 

5. Housing Rates: (Line chart) The variables of property price or housing rate in this chart are considered as continuous and numerical data types. While a histogram is typically preferred for analyzing continuous data, in this instance, my goal is to demonstrate the correlation between the three variables across different continents, allowing the audience to easily compare and analyze the pattern. Therefore, a line graph is the most suitable option to showcase the linear relationship between these variables. Additionally, one can add a second or more lines to compare the data. The graph follows the convention of the zero-axis rule and is appropriately labeled.

## Things that went well with this dashboard: 
Tufte's principles provide guidance on accurately representing data through visual elements. He recommends selecting a suitable chart and format, using an appropriate scale, and combining words, numbers, and illustrations to present complex data in a simple and accessible way. 

• It follows simplicity which communicates with users clearly and effectively.

• No Lie factor present the data presented is accurate as provided in the dataset file and the representation of data is proportional to the data itself. Representations of numbers are directly proportional to the numerical quantities present.

• Virtual Integrity secured by properly proportionate numerical scales and not fudged to exaggerate the fall or rise of a curve at a particular point

• High data ink ratio and maximum information in the smallest space described in this dashboard.

### Font: 
• The dashboard is in formal font that is highly legible, free of visual clutter, and exhibits excellent visual hierarchy. • The dashboard incorporates appropriate sizing for figures and text to emphasize the title, axis labels, data labels, and legends accurately. 

### Color: 
• The use of color is a crucial aspect of graphics. By choosing natural and restrained color palettes for charts can reduce the need for users to constantly refer to the legend, allowing them to focus more on the data presented.

### Legends:
• Legends are provided where necessary to distinguish between the variables with proper format and position without adding any junk in charts. 

### Labels: 
• Axis labels and data labels are added where necessary to avoid visual clutters.

### Numbers:
• There are no long decimal values, no zero preceding decimals in the axes. • Details added in tooltips to read the data values on hovering. 

### Interactives:

• The dashboard includes a selection tool that enables users to choose graphs by continent.
• Another notable feature is the ability to highlight data values in all graphs of a selected country by choosing it on a map. 
• Data labels are shown by hovering on the variable.
• Two themes swapping by toggle key present in the top-right corner. Analysis - 

## Things that can be Improved: 
• This dashboard has few limitations as users can only fetch data by continents, which can be improved by Global comparison. 

• While this visualization is nice, there is always room for further improvement.
